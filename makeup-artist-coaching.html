                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Our client is a highly skilled, self-employed makeup artist with a natural talent for creating flawless looks for weddings, special occasions, and photoshoots. Her artistry and personal touch had earned her a loyal following and glowing word-of-mouth referrals. However, like many creatives, her passion lay in the work itself—not in running the business behind it.</p>
                    <p>While her calendar often included weekend bookings and returning clients, she had no formal marketing strategy, no consistent way of attracting new clients online, and little visibility over her finances. With ambitions to grow her brand and make her business more sustainable, she reached out for support.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Limited Business Knowledge</strong> She was confident with makeup but unsure how to run the business side effectively—especially when it came to setting prices, tracking income, or planning for the future.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Online Presence</strong> She had no website and struggled with using social media to showcase her work. Most of her bookings came through word of mouth, making her business vulnerable to slow periods.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Use of Testimonials or Branding</strong> Although she had plenty of happy clients, she hadn't collected reviews or built a consistent brand identity, which made it harder to stand out in a competitive market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unclear Financial Picture</strong> She didn't have a system for tracking income, expenses, or profitability, and often felt unsure about whether she was charging enough or managing her money well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Business Foundations</strong> We started by helping her get clarity on her goals and target market. We reviewed her pricing and service packages to ensure she was charging fairly for her time and talent, while also covering costs and earning sustainably.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing and Online Presence</strong> Together, we built a simple but professional website to showcase her portfolio, services, and contact info. We also created a social media plan she felt confident using—based on real-life images of her work and client testimonials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Client Testimonials and Trust</strong> We introduced a process to collect reviews from past clients and feature them on her website and social platforms, adding trust and credibility that led to an increase in new enquiries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Confidence</strong> Using easy-to-follow templates, we set up a simple system to track income and expenses. For the first time, she understood where her money was going and how to plan for quieter months.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>After just three months, the client saw a noticeable increase in enquiries, especially from social media and her new website. She also felt more confident quoting prices, managing bookings, and speaking about her business. Most importantly, she no longer felt overwhelmed or "not good at business"—she felt in control, supported, and excited about what's next.</p>
