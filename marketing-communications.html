                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>We work with a wide range of businesses—across sectors such as professional services, technology, creative industries, and health & wellbeing—who are great at what they do but often lack the time, expertise, or internal resource to effectively communicate their value to the market.</p>
                    <p>These businesses typically grow through word of mouth or strong delivery, but as they look to scale, they recognise the need for a more structured and proactive approach to marketing and communications. Many come to us with inconsistent messaging, underused social media channels, and missed opportunities to generate leads through events or content.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inconsistent or Ad-Hoc Marketing</strong> Businesses often post irregularly on social media, lack a clear content plan, and aren't sure how to turn activity into results.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Clear Messaging</strong> Their value is clear internally but isn't well communicated externally. Messaging is often outdated, unclear, or varies depending on who's speaking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Underused Content Opportunities</strong> Blog posts, newsletters, and thought leadership pieces are sporadic or non-existent, despite deep expertise within the business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Events Not Used Strategically</strong> Webinars, roundtables, and in-person events happen occasionally but aren't aligned with wider marketing goals or followed up effectively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Lead Generation from Marketing</strong> Marketing activities may raise visibility but aren't translating into meaningful, qualified leads or new business opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Planning</strong> We start by understanding each business's goals, audience, and offer. From there, we develop a practical marketing plan that includes messaging, content themes, key channels, and a calendar of activity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Media Strategy and Delivery</strong> We create consistent, professional social media plans that align with business objectives—helping clients share their stories, showcase their expertise, and build engagement with their target audiences. We provide both strategy and hands-on delivery, depending on internal capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Creation</strong> We help businesses bring their knowledge to life through blogs, articles, newsletters, case studies, and downloadable resources. This positions them as experts, supports SEO, and provides assets that can be reused across marketing channels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Events and Campaigns</strong> We support the planning, promotion, and follow-up of events—from webinars to roundtables to launches. Events become a strategic part of lead generation, with clear messaging, branded materials, and audience follow-up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Messaging and Brand Positioning</strong> We work with clients to define or refine their core messaging—ensuring it's clear, consistent, and compelling across all platforms, from websites to proposals to social posts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>As a result, our clients see increased visibility, better engagement with target audiences, and more qualified leads. Just as importantly, they feel more confident and in control of their marketing—with a clearer voice, a stronger brand, and a practical plan that supports their growth.</p>
